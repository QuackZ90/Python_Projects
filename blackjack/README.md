This folder contains the code for a simple blackjack game attempted using object oriented programming concept.

In this game, a player challenges the computer (the dealer) to a game of blackjack.

To increase the difficulty of the game, the computer was given ability to 'see' the player's card. As such, the computer will always draw a card if it's value is below the 16 or below the player's value.

In this version, the 5 card rule is not included.
